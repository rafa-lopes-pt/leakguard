# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `leakguard ignore <file|dir>` -- exempt paths from scans without hand-editing config. A file is added to both `.security-filetypes` `[allowed-files]` (allows a blocked filetype, e.g. an auto-generated SVG) and `.gitleaks.toml` `[allowlist].paths` (skips the secret scan); a directory is added to gitleaks only. Supports `-l`/`--list` and `-r`/`--remove`. Regex metacharacters in paths are auto-escaped.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-04-30

### Added

- Persisted deploy password: `leakguard deploy` remembers the archive password between runs (encrypted in gitignored `.deploy-password.enc`, keyed off `.security-key`)
- `leakguard deploy --reset-password` -- force prompt and re-save
- `leakguard deploy --no-save-password` -- prompt without offering to save
- `leakguard deploy --forget-password` -- delete the saved deploy password
- `setup-dist` prompts whether to track the dist folder in the source repo (default: track) -- enables source-mirror workflows where the dist contents are version-controlled
- `distFolderTracked` key persisted in `.leakguardrc` so re-running `setup-dist` defaults to the previous choice

### Changed

- `setup-dist` no longer auto-gitignores the local dist folder; the user chooses
- Deploy `.7z` mode now feeds the password via argv (`-p<pw>`) instead of an interactive 7z prompt, enabling reuse of the saved password (visible in `/proc/<pid>/cmdline` while 7z runs)

## [1.1.0] - 2026-04-26

### Added

- npm version, downloads, license, and node version badges to README
- npm install command at top of README
- Receiver: side-by-side layout (file list on left, preview on right)
- Receiver: search bar for filtering files by name
- Receiver: copy-to-clipboard button in the file viewer
- `leakguard lint` command for on-demand security scanning (all tracked files, specific paths, or `--staged`)
- `leakguard deploy --expires` for time-limited deployments (auto-expire deployed content)
- Deploy expiry config key (`expires=30m`) with duration, ISO date, and "never" support
- GitHub Actions expire workflow auto-generated in -dist repos (hourly check, content wipe or repo deletion)

### Changed

- Dist README checksums now use fenced code blocks (enables GitHub copy button)
- Dist README explains that only the first checksum is real in chunked mode
- Renamed reassemble.html to leakguard-receiver.html
- Receiver: wider max-width (1200px) to accommodate side-by-side layout
- Receiver: responsive stacked layout on narrow screens (< 768px)

### Removed
